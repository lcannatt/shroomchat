# ShroomChat
An end to end encrypted chat room service with minimal user data retention and radical client trust.

## Motivation
A proof of concept for a web based E2EE messaging service, and an excuse to learn node.js/react basics.

### What it does

* Shroomchat is a socket.io based chat platform that does not retain communication content on the server.
* All data besides room target and authentication information is sent to the server encrypted using openPGP with a key the server does not possess.
* Chat history is stored only on the client, and may be retrieved by joining users on entry.
* Room Ids are randomly generated by the server and purged/recycled when the last user leaves.

### Spinup

```
npm install
node server
```

### Dependencies

npm
* express
* socket.io
